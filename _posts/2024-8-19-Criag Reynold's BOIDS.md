## BOIDS

BOIDS is an algorythm used to describe the movement of birds in a flock. It was developed by Craig Reynolds to explore a way of understanding the flocking behaviour of birds. It produces something that looks remarkably like flocking birds and has been used extensively in many areas of computing to create crows simulations and similar behvoiurs.

The algorithm can be rendered in 2D or 3D. This is an example of a programme I wrote in Openframeworks that is based on BOIDS. It was on an old MacBook.
