I have been meaning to do some stuff with three js for ages. A few years ago I did some interactive visuals using Openframeworks in C++ on a white unibody Macbook.

Three js is pretty comparable to Openframeworks now and the power of most laptops means that running these kind of interactive visuals through the browser on a laptop is very doable. Anyway here it is, it’s going to be a virtual billboard screen. I intend to add bloom post processing and lighting effects and some kind of text/video driver.

I seem to have broken it!! So here is a link to a voxel array I did.
