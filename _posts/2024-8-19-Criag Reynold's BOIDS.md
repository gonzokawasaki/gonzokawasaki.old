## BOIDS

When completing my Masters at Ravensbourne I created some interactive pieces using OpenFrameworks. I have to say I absolutely love the forgiving nature of OFx. You can hack away at the code without really breaking anything. It is great fun to work with and more like scripting than working with C++. For the most part you work with already existing libraries and hack away inside the example code.

This is a boids simulation plugged into an Xbox Kinect. The viewer can then influence the 3D painting the flocking boids draw. The boids were actually programmed to fly away from user input. Perhaps another generation could have seen them flock to user input so as to give the user more direct control over the ‘painting’.

BOIDS is an algorythm used to describe the movement of birds in a flock. It was developed by Craig Reynolds to explore a way of understanding the flocking behaviour of birds. It produces something that looks remarkably like flocking birds and has been used extensively in many areas of computing to create crows simulations and similar behvoiurs.

The algorithm can be rendered in 2D or 3D. All done on an on an old white MacBook.
