## Old SFX Video 

As part of an animation and games design course I taught on in the UK me and the students had a go at doing some SFX compositing. This was pretty time consuming even with Mac Xeon towers.

We used PFHoe to solve for the camera and then imported the solved scene into Blender. I seem to remember it taking a few weeks before we got a good solve from a piece of footage. Pixel Farm is no longer in business but their products helped provide low cost SFX software that otherwise would have cost many thousands of dollars.
